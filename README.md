Daily Scheduler

Repo for schedule

## Description
The main goal of this challenge is to demonstrate and apply the html, css, and javascript that we have learned so far.
Through completeing this challenge we will be able to demonstrate how to build and edit our own code and apply js to make a daily calender that tracks the time and saves whatever is written into the slots. The scheduler also keeps track of the time and color codes the time blocks according to past, present, and future based on the time of day.

## Purpose
The purpose is to use our knowledge gained from the previous weeks and apply them to a new project that involves using code that we have created to make the daily scheduler app by using a pre-built framework with html and css, and making it interactive using javascript.
- The motivation for this project is to be able to display the ability to follow instructions, implement, and display a working end product.
- This project was created to simulate an on the job experience and deliver a working product for the share holder/employer.
- This project solve issues related to being able to take a starter code and edit into a working product that can be deployed to the customer.
- In this project I learned:
  - How to apply third party api to access the time of day with dayjs.
  - bootstrap for the outline and editing the page.
  - Utilizing javascript to make the scheduler save the time, display time and text written, keep track of the date and time and display it, track the time of day by color coding the time blocks after checking the time block against the day js and giving it the display of black for past, blue for present, and green for future..
